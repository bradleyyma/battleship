    <string name="help_text_1">Be the first to destroy your opponent\'s fleet.
        \n\n
        Each fleet is made up of four ships of different shapes and sizes. The ships are Minesweeper, Destroyer,
        Battleship, and Submarine.

        \n\n
        In the first phase of the game, you get to place your
        ships on the grid. The gray spots represent the places where your ships are and the green spots represent were the
        captain quarters of the ships are. Captain quarters are armored and will show up as a miss when they are first hit. However,
        if the captain quarters are hit again, the ship will sink. Note that the Minesweeper does not have armored
        captain quarters.
        \n\n
        In the second phase of the game you will have a chance to attack one square of the opponent. Blue represents a
        miss and red represents a hit. Sink all of your opponents ships to win.
        \n\n
        Good Luck!
