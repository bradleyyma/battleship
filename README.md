#### Team Members : Bradley Ma, Maksim Vasilyev, Jaskrit Singh, Anusha Basavaraja,

This github repo contains the code for a Java and Android implementation of the game Battleship. It was created for a 
class at CU Boulder called Object Oriented Analysis & Design during the Spring 2021 semester by Bradley Ma, Jaskrit Singh, Maksim Vasilyev, and early contribution from Anusha Basavaraja. 

Our project utilizes the Android SDK, so this must be installed

Our project can be run either through an android emulator, or through an android device on developer mode. One of these must be available before running our project.
